### Code challenge task

```
- Clone the repository locally
- Create a new branch
---------------------------------------
- Refactor the code so that it is scalable and reusable (hint: Reusable components. What if we decided to do a date picker for the Mars images? Don't add one, but think of scalability)
- Do not use CSS/SCSS. Do not use bootstrap or any other styling library. Only use vue-styled-components
- Make use of vuex
- The design is not so important here
- Program in Vue 2
